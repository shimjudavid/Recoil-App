# Simple React app with Recoil for state management

Recoil is a new (experimental!) library from facebook that can handle complex shared data across a large react app.

In this collection, we'll create a simple game with React using Recoil, to explore how you can share and update state across an app.

Recoil is similar to (but different than) Context, Redux, or other shared state libraries (like MobX), but is designed to handle large (and variable) numbers of state that can update without re-rendering your entire app's component tree.
